## Issues and Feature Requests
Questions, feature requests and bug reports are all welcome as [discussions or issues](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-metadata-mapper/issues). Please use the provided [templates](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-metadata-mapper/issues/new/choose) to ensure we have enough information to work with.

NOTE: If your package requires upgrading pydantic, create a separate ticket and a dedicated engineer will handle the upgrade.
## Installation and Development
To develop the software, *clone* the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
Please do not fork this repository unless you are an external developer.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-metadata-mapper.git
git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch
``` 
Then in bash, run
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```
to set up your environment. Once these steps are complete, you can get developingðŸš€.
### Testing

Testing is required to open a PR in this repository to ensure robustness and reliability of our codebase. 
- **1:1 Correspondence:** Structure unit tests in a manner that mirrors the module structure. 
  - For every package in the src directory, there should be a corresponding test package.
  - For every module in a package, there should be a corresponding unit test module.
  - For every method in a module, there should be a corresponding unit test.
- **Test Coverage:** Aim for comprehensive test coverage to validate all critical paths and edge cases within the module. To open a PR, you will need at least 80% coverage. 
  - Please test your changes using the **coverage** library, which will run the tests and log a coverage report:
    ```bash
    coverage run -m unittest discover && coverage report
    ```
    To open the coverage report in a browser, you can run
    ```bash
    coverage html
    ```
    and find the report in the htmlcov/index.html.

There are several libraries used to run linters and check documentation. We've included these in the development package. You can run them as described [here](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-metadata-mapper/blob/main/README.md#linters-and-testing).
