Data description
================

**Q: What is the data description file?**

This tracks administrative information about a data asset, including affiliated researchers/organizations, projects,
data modalities, dates of collection, and more.

**Q: How do I create the data description?**

The data description is created during data transfer based on information you provide to that service and pulling 
information from internal resources.

Questions for AIND users
------------------------

**Q: This data is for a AIND project and not part of a grant. Shouldn’t the funder be AIND?**

No. The funding for internally funded AIND or AIBS work is listed as “Allen Institute”.

**Q: I got a new grant! How do I make sure this grant information will get integrated into the metadata?**

Congratulations! The funding information is pulled from the Funding Smartsheet that Shelby maintains. Work with Shelby 
to make sure your grant is on that sheet.

**What are “Institution” and “Group” doing in data_description.json?**

In the future we may need to tag cloud resources based on the originating 
group, which may or may not be in AIND, in order to track usage and spending.
