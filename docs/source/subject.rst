Questions for AIND users
------------------------

**Q: How do I create a subject file?**

The metadata service (http://aind-metadata-service/) pulls metadata from LabTracks about our mice. If you are using 
a subject that is not from our animal facility, you will need to create this manually. You can either use the GUI 
(https://metadata-entry.allenneuraldynamics.org/) or write python code that imports aind-data-schema.
